# RainbowPuff
This website showcases an exceptional collection of dresses created through the power of artificial intelligence. As a fashion enthusiast and AI hobbyist, I decided to explore the intersection of these two fields, resulting in an experimental and captivating dress collection.

Each dress in this collection is the result of hours of experimentation and design. Using advanced algorithms and data analysis, I've trained an AI model to generate dress designs that are both innovative and stylish.

The result is a collection of dresses that pushes the boundaries of what's possible in the world of fashion.You can view the project live [here](https://larissasoares.com/projects/rainbowpuff/).
